## Description

_This website allows a users to enter their age. Based on the age inputted, if they're 21 or older, it will display a drink menu. Otherwise, it will display a message explaining the reason as to why they can't view the menu. This was a homework assignment I worked on for my school [**Epicodus**](https://www.epicodus.com/). The project was a way for me to showcase my understanding of JavaScript branching, i.e. if and else conditional statements._
